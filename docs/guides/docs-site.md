# Docs site workflow

Tandem documentation uses two directories:

- `docs/` is the canonical Markdown source.
- `site/` is the Astro Starlight project that renders and builds the static site.

Do not edit generated Markdown copies under `site/src/content/docs/`. Run the sync step after changing `docs/`.

## Install dependencies

From the repository root:

```sh
cd site
npm install
```

## Preview locally

```sh
cd site
npm run dev
```

The `predev` hook syncs `../docs/` into Starlight before the dev server starts.

## Build static output

```sh
cd site
npm run build
```

The `prebuild` hook runs `npm run sync:docs`, then Astro writes static output to `site/dist/`.

## Manual sync

```sh
cd site
npm run sync:docs
```

Use this when you want to inspect the generated Starlight content before previewing or building.

## Maintenance notes

- Commit source changes under `docs/` and site tooling changes under `site/`.
- Do not commit `site/dist/`, `site/.astro/`, or `site/node_modules/`.
- Keep generated `site/src/content/docs/**/*.md` out of version control; it exists only to bridge canonical docs into Starlight.
## GitHub Pages deployment

The workflow `.github/workflows/docs.yml` builds the Starlight site and deploys `site/dist/` to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` or manual dispatch. Pull requests run the build and upload step but skip deployment.

Repository setup required in GitHub:

1. Open **Settings → Pages**.
2. Set **Build and deployment → Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Ensure Actions are enabled for the private repository and the `github-pages` environment can deploy.

The site config currently uses `site: 'https://algorant.github.io'` and `base: '/tandem'`, matching the expected GitHub Pages project URL.
