# Tandem

Tandem is a draft local-first protocol and toolchain for human/agent project coordination.

It takes inspiration from Brainfile's file-based task board model, but leans harder into collaborative workflows: humans and agents agree on work through **accords**, move delivered work through review, and preserve completed work in useful logs.

Current design baseline: use Brainfile as inspiration for the general protocol/CLI/TUI shape, adapt it into Tandem terminology, and fold in the local Brainfile v3 direction around review, completion/archive, and first-class logs. Tandem does not require Brainfile import/migration or ongoing Brainfile nomenclature compatibility. The v0 `tandem` CLI surface is implemented and considered complete for the current known scope; forward implementation focus is the Rust/Ratatui TUI plus lightweight agent/editor integrations over `tandem`.

## Naming

- Product/protocol: **Tandem**
- Repository: `tandem`
- Project data directory: `.tandem/`
- Project config file: `.tandem/tandem.md`
- CLI binary: `tandem`
- CLI/TUI directory: `tandem/`
- Integrations directory: `extensions/`
- Pi extension adapter: `pi-tandem`
- Work agreement object: `accord`
- User-facing CLI: `tandem`; reserved future/internal prefix: `td`

## Locked v0 scope

- Protocol version: `0.1.0` for the first v0 draft.
- Protocol fields: `state`/`states`, `type: task`, sequential `task-N` IDs.
- Default states: `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`.
- Document types: `task` and `decision`; custom types are config-only.
- Accord statuses: `ready`, `claimed`, `delivered`, `accepted`, `rework`, `failed`, `blocked`.
- Logs: archived markdown docs in `.tandem/logs/`; minimal audit-only lifecycle events in `.tandem/events.jsonl`.
- v0 `tandem` commands: `init`, `list`, `show`, `add`, `move`, `complete`, `log`, `search`, `accord`, `rules`, `decision`, `tui`; `tandem decision` supports `list`, `show`, `add`.
- Validation: strict structure/core refs; unresolved `parentId`/`blockers` are errors while related `references` are warnings.
- Decision docs: no lifecycle field required in v0.
- First implementation: Rust inside `tandem/`, currently as one `tandem` binary crate with `yaml-rust2` parsing, raw-source CLI mutations, and a Ratatui/crossterm TUI module.
- CLI output: human-readable by default using compact tables/detail blocks; all read commands support `--json` envelope objects.
- TUI invocation: `tandem tui` only in v0.
- First TUI MVP: board mutations, Board/Review/Logs/Rules/Decisions views, theme support, mouse enabled by default without drag/drop, simple filtered Review queue, fixed default keymaps, and styled-basic Markdown rendering; the current Board uses count-labeled state subviews with a full-width selected-state list rather than simultaneous columns.
- V0 CLI aliases: none; canonical commands and long flags only.
- V0 repo shape: CLI/TUI implementation stays under `tandem/`; agent/editor adapters live under `extensions/`; no root Rust workspace, schemas, or fixtures.
- Theme config loading order: built-in defaults, user TOML themes in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tandem/themes/*.toml` or `~/.config/tandem/themes/*.toml`, then workspace selector/override at `.tandem/theme.toml` (for example `theme = "verdigris"`).
- Planning docs remain Markdown for now; migrate/dogfood Tandem documents after the TUI can manage them safely.
- `extensions/pi-tandem` is a lightweight Pi adapter over an installed `tandem` CLI. It uses safe argument arrays, prefers `tandem --json` read paths, and does not duplicate Tandem protocol parsing/mutation logic.
